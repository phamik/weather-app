This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run this project, clone this repo and run `npm install` in the root of the project.

The frontend is done using React.js, fetching data from a mocked backend using [JSON server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).
